			<h3>Services</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>Inspection:</strong> Each agreement to service begins with an inspection and evaluation of the components to be serviced. Customers are responsible for shipping all content to JC Auto Restoration, however they are not charged for the time it takes to complete this inspection. Following the inspection a quote, which includes estimated parts and labor costs, will be delivered to the customer. If the customer agrees to this quote, work will begin on a first-come first-served basis, where other jobs may take precedence if they arrived earlier. If the customer chooses not to proceed with services, they are responsible for covering the cost of shipping to return all components.  
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Estimates:</strong> For the quote, most parts needed will be assigned a flat fee based on market value. Standard services (available on our <%= link_to "services", "/our-services", style: "font-weight: 500" %> page) will be added as needed and priced as specified on our <%= link_to "services", "/our-services", style: "font-weight: 500" %> page. If there is no flat rate specified for a service required, hours will be estimated based on statistics from previous projects, and all labor will be billed at $95 per hour. Although we strive to be as accurate as possible when determining hours, the final time spent on a project could be more or less than quoted due to factors that cannot be identified upon initial inspection. If that is the case, and it is anticipated that more hours will be required than initially quoted, the customer will be contacted for a decision on how to proceed.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Rebuilding Parts:</strong> When rebuilding parts, we require all MoPar parts and will not service any aftermarket components.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Shipping:</strong> The customer is required to pay all shipping costs to and from the shop. The only exemptions to this rule are any components that must be returned under warranty, in which case JC Auto Restoration can be contacted to arrange shipping. JC Auto Restoration, Inc. is not responsible for any loss or damage sustained during shipping or customs inspections (applicable to international orders).
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Timing:</strong> Turn around times cannot be guaranteed and depend on the availability of parts and labor. Services will be performed on a first-come first-served basis. All services requiring Core Parts may take longer to allow for time to find and determine the quality of core components.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Core Parts:</strong> Core charges include the part alone and do not include the labor required to restore the part. The additional charge will be included in the initial inspection and estimate.
			</p>

			<a name="warranty"></a>
			<h3>Warranty</h3>
			<p>
				All rebuilt parts have a one-year warranty from date of shipment or pick up. The part must remain undisturbed for the warranty to be valid. Any damage obtained due to user error upon installation will void the warranty. For more information on handling, installing, and removing parts please see our <%= link_to "How to Guide", "/our-services#how", style: "font-weight: 500" %> on the services page.
			</p>

			<a name="inventory"></a>
			<h3>Inventory</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>Prices:</strong> We try to maintain accurate prices for each product in our online store. However, given the number of parts we keep in stock, prices will not always be accurate and may change at any time based on market value and supply/demand. All prices listed on the website for parts and services are subject to change. 
			</p>
			<p>	
				<strong>Returns:</strong> Returns are accepted up to one month on parts purchased from JC Auto Restoration, Inc. The customer is responsible for paying the cost of shipping for all returns. Returns of 5 parts or more will be subject to a 10% restocking fee.
			</p>

			<a name="shipping"></a>
			<h3>Shipping</h3>
			<p>We have constructed a complex algorithm that utilizes part sizes and your shipping address to calculate shipping prices as accurately as possible. If you have any questions about shipping prices, please contact us using the form <%= link_to "here", "/contact", style: "font-weight: 700" %>. Please include the order number in the message field.
			<p>
				<strong>US Prices:</strong> Shipping prices for US orders are based on a percentage of the total price of your order unless parts fit into one of our flat rate boxes. This percentage is determined by the zone system pictured below. Minimum shipping prices of $15 for the lower 48 states and $25 for Alaska and Hawaii are enforced. If a part does fit into a flat rate box you will be charged the rate for that box plus additional insurance based on the value of the package.

				<strong>International Prices:</strong> Due to the high variance in the cost to ship outside the US, we are unable to calculate our shipping price for international orders ahead of time. Once your order is submitted, we will calculate the cost of shipping and contact you for approval. Once you have approved the final price, we will collect payment and ship your order.
